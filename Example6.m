clear P % Parameters struct

% This example consists of a straight Fermat's Golden Spiral multicore
% fiber. An input E-field has been pre-computed and is loaded from the file
% ExampleInputField.mat. The field is first propagated through the
% multicore fiber with FDBPM and then through air using FFTBPM. With this
% E-field input, a focal spot is formed at a distance of 5 mm from the
% distal end of the fiber in air. Compare to example 7, in which the fibre
% is bent.

% A video is saved, showing both simulation segments. Because we want both
% segments in one video file, we have to defer saving the video file efter
% the first segment by setting P.finalizeVideo = false in the first segment

%% General and solver-related settings
P.name = mfilename;
P.useAllCPUs = true; % If false, BPM-Matlab will leave one processor unused. Useful for doing other work on the PC while simulations are running.
P.useGPU = false; % (Default: false) Use CUDA acceleration for NVIDIA GPUs

%% Visualization parameters
P.figTitle = 'In straight fibre';
P.videoName = 'Example6.avi';
P.saveVideo = true; % To save the field intensity and phase profiles at different transverse planes
P.finalizeVideo = false; % finalizeVideo should only be set to true in the last segment to be simulated.
P.updates = 30;            % Number of times to update plot. Must be at least 1, showing the final state.
P.downsampleImages = false; % Due to a weird MATLAB bug, MATLAB may crash when having created imagesc (or image) plots with dimensions larger than roughly 2500x2500 and then calling mex functions repeatedly. This flag will enable downsampling to 500x500 of all data before plotting, hopefully avoiding the issue.
P.displayScaling = 1;  % Zooms in on figures. Set to 1 for no zooming.  

%% Resolution-related parameters (check for convergence)
P.Lx_main = 200e-6;        % [m] x side length of main area
P.Ly_main = 200e-6;        % [m] y side length of main area
P.Nx_main = 600;          % x resolution of main area
P.Ny_main = 600;          % y resolution of main area
P.padfactor = 1.1;  % How much absorbing padding to add on the sides of the main area (1 means no padding, 2 means the absorbing padding on both sides is of thickness Lx_main/2)
P.dz_target = 0.4e-6; % [m] z step size to aim for
P.alpha = 3e14;             % [1/m^3] "Absorption coefficient" per squared unit length distance out from edge of main area

%% Problem definition - straight multicore fibre
P.lambda = 980e-9; % [m] Wavelength
P.n_background = 1.45; % [] (may be complex) Background refractive index, (in this case, the cladding)
P.n_0 = 1.46; % [] reference refractive index
P.Lz = 0.3e-3; % [m] z propagation distances for this segment
P.bendDirection = 0; % [degrees] direction of the bending, in a polar coordinate system with 0Â° to the right (towards positive x) and increasing angles in counterclockwise direction
P.bendingRoC = Inf; % [m] radius of curvature of the bend

nCores = 30;  %[] Number of cores in the multicore fibre
pitch = 15e-6; % [m] Intercore spacing
R = 2e-6; % [m] Core radius
n_core = 1.46; % Cores' refractive index 

% See the readme file for details on P.shapes
P.shapes = NaN(nCores,5);
P.shapes(:,1) = pitch*sqrt(1:nCores).*cos((1:nCores)*pi*(3-sqrt(5))); % Fermat's Golden Spiral core x positions
P.shapes(:,2) = pitch*sqrt(1:nCores).*sin((1:nCores)*pi*(3-sqrt(5))); % Fermat's Golden Spiral core y positions
P.shapes(:,3) = R;
