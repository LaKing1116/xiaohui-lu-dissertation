%% Function ModeOverlap -  Overlap integral calculation %%
% This function calculates the overlap integral for two input fields and
% deliver an output cell containing the coefficients and the absolute
% squared values (fractional power). 

% Input parameters:
% Emat_data: A NxN complex single valued matrix, containing the electric field
% for the mode overlap is being considered. 
% Ecell_mode: A cell structure or matrix containing the electric fields for
% which the mode overlap integral is being considered, with respect to
% Emat_data.

% Output parameters:
% Ccell_out: A 2x1 cell structure containing the overlap coefficients in 
% entry 1 and the absolute squared coefficient value (fractional power) in
% entry 2. 


% Note that Emat_data must be an NxN complex single valued matrix. Ecell_mode
% must be either a cell structure containing containing a number of complex
% single valued matrices or a NxN complex singled valued matrix.
